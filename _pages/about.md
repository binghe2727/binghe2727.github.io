- I am an Applied Scientist II at AWS Amazon Q Developer/CodeLLM team since May 2024. Before that, I obtained my CS PhD from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and was co-advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and [Prof. Mustaque Ahamad](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mustaque-ahamad).
- My research interests include **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Large Language Model**, and **Deep Learning**. Especially at AWS, I work on large language models (LLM) for code ranging from fundamental LLM reasoning and planning to agentic code generation, documentation, and transformation.

- My research goal is to **develop advanced machine learning methods to enhance the safety and integrity for web users and communities for social good**.
- My **research interests** include:
  - **Machine Learning**: Multi-task Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Few-shot Learning, Representation learning
  - **Natural Language Processing**: Text Classification, Text Generation
  - **Graph Mining**: Graph Neural Network, Dynamic Graph Representation
  - **Computational Social Science**: 
    - **Misinformation/Fake News/Hate Speech/Fraud/Rumour**: Misinformation/Fake News/Hate Speech Detection, User Fraud and Risk Modeling
    - **Social Network Analysis**: Social Computing, User Behavior Modeling, Information Propagation

Before joining Georgia Tech, I was advised by [Prof. Lionel M. Ni](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~ni/), [Prof. Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/) and Dr. Min Gao 
  at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
  I got my bachelor from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
