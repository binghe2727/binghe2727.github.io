- I am a fourth-year CS PhD student 
  co-advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and 
  [Prof. Mustaque Ahamad](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mustaque-ahamad) 
  at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).
- My research goal is to **develop advanced computational methods 
  to enhance the safety and integrity for web users and communities for the ultimate social good**.
- My **research interests** include:
  - **Machine Learning**: Multi-task Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Few-shot Learning, Deep Learning, Representation learning
  - **Natural Language Processing**: Text Classification, Text Generation
  - **Graph Mining**: Graph Neural Network, Dynamic Graph Representation, Node Classification, Node Representation Learning
  - **Misinformation/Hate Speech**: Misinformation/Fake News/False/Hate Speech Information Detection, Characterization, and Mitigation
  - **Applied Machine Learning**: Machine Learning Application in Misinformation, Hate speech, Fake News, User Fraud and Risk Domain
- Before joining Georgia Tech, I was advised by [Prof. Lionel M. Ni](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~ni/), [Prof. Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/) and Dr. Min Gao 
  at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
  I got my bachelor from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
