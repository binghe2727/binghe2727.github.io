- I am a forth-year CS PhD student 
  co-advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and 
  [Prof. Mustaque Ahamad](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mustaque-ahamad) 
  at Georgia Institute of Technology.
- My research interests include machine learning, natural language process, and graph mining 
  with application in misinformation, hate speech, user fraud and risk domain.
- Before joining Georgia Tech, I was advised by Prof. Lionel M. Ni, Prof. Lei Chen and Dr. Min Gao 
  at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
  I got my bachelor from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
