- I am a fourth-year CS PhD student 
  co-advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and 
  [Prof. Mustaque Ahamad](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mustaque-ahamad) 
  at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).
- My research goal is to **develop advanced computational methods 
  to enhance the safety and integrity for web users and communities**.
- My research interests include **machine learning, natural language process, and graph mining 
  with applications in misinformation, hate speech, fake news, user fraud and user risk**.
- Before joining Georgia Tech, I was advised by [Prof. Lionel M. Ni](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~ni/), [Prof. Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/) and Dr. Min Gao 
  at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 
  I got my bachelor from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
