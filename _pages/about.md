1. how do I add the potential graduation year such that recruiter can find you very quickly?
-->

- I am the final-year(fifth-year) CS PhD student co-advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) and [Prof. Mustaque Ahamad](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mustaque-ahamad) homed in School of Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

- My foucs of research area is **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My research topic is to design advanced NLP methods to _characterize, detect, and mitigate_ incorrect and harmful contents generated by: (1) <ins>human</ins>, e.g., misinformation, fake news, hate speech, rumor, and fraud; (2) <ins>machines</ins>, e.g., hallucinations in/alignment of/evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs).
  - Methodology: Multi-task Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Few-shot Learning, Representation learning
  - Application: Text Classification, Text Generation, Computational Social Science
- I am looking for **full-time research scientist/data scientist/applied scientist positions or similar roles**. Please contact me if you are hiring or know good positions!
