Some experience by Bing:
1. Even if we set the /404.html
2. After redirection in cv-file, it will still go to my cv-file. Nice for the setup.


Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist --- perhaps you can try searching for it below.

  var GOOG_FIXURL_LANG = 'en';
  var GOOG_FIXURL_SITE = '{{ site.url }}'
